# Variables

## What is a Variable?
A variable is a name that stores a value in memory.

## Syntax
```python
x = 10
name = "Shadab"
```

## Dynamic Typing
Python automatically detects the datatype.

C
```c
int x = 10;
```

Python
```python
x = 10
```

## Memory (id)
Variables storing the same immutable value may point to the same memory location.

```python
x = 5
y = 5

print(id(x))
print(id(y))
```

Both IDs are usually the same.

## Variable Naming Rules
- Letters, digits and `_` allowed
- Cannot start with a digit
- No spaces
- No special characters (`@`, `#`, `%`, etc.)
- Cannot use Python keywords
- Use meaningful names

✅ `student_name`

❌ `student name`

❌ `2name`

## Case Sensitive
```python
age = 20
Age = 30
```

Both are different variables.

## Keywords
Avoid using Python keywords as variable names.

Example:
```python
if = 10 ❌
```

## help()
Displays documentation about Python objects and functions.

```python
help()
```

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful names
- Follow `snake_case`
- Avoid one-letter names (except loops)

```python
student_name = "Shadab"
```

## Common Mistakes
❌ `my name = "John"`

✅ `my_name = "John"`

## Interview Nugget ⭐
Python is **dynamically typed**, but also **strongly typed**.

Dynamic → No datatype declaration needed.

Strong → Python doesn't automatically mix incompatible types.

```python
"5" + 5   # Error
```

### 30-Second Revision
- Variable stores data.
- No datatype declaration.
- Dynamically typed.
- Case-sensitive.
- No spaces.
- No keywords.
- Same immutable value may share the same memory (`id()`).
